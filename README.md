Hello! I am a 16-year-old enthusiast in computer science and telecommunications. Currently, I am attending the third year at the Verona Trento Messina Scientific High School,
where I am specializing in this fascinating field of study.
My curiosity for digital technologies and the world of telecommunications has motivated me to dive deeper into this learning journey.

Throughout my studies, I have gained in-depth skills in programming and designing computer systems.
I am particularly excited about exploring challenges related to Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, and communication networks.
In labs and practical lessons, I have had the opportunity to apply my knowledge, contributing to the consolidation of my passion for the world of technology.

Outside the classroom, I also dedicate myself to personal projects that allow me to apply acquired skills and further explore the new frontiers of computer science and telecommunications.
I am always on the lookout for stimulating challenges and new opportunities to expand my knowledge in this ever-evolving field.
